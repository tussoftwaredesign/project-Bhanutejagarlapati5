Bookstore Management System
A Java-based Bookstore Management System developed as part of the OOP2 module. It is designed to simulate real-world bookstore operations with a focus on modern Java 21 features and industry-level coding practices.

Features

Add, update, and manage books and customers

Handle different membership types: Regular, Silver, Gold

Apply tier-based benefits and discounts

Sort and filter collections using Streams and Lambdas

Group and partition data using Collectors

Perform concurrent book searches

Load book data from files using NIO2

Format output according to locale settings

Tech Stack

Language: Java 21 (LTS)

Architecture: Modular, layered (models, services, members, main)

Concurrency: ExecutorService

File Handling: NIO2 (Paths, Files)

Date Handling: LocalDate, DateTimeFormatter

Functional Programming: Lambdas, Streams, Functional Interfaces

OOP Enhancements: Sealed classes, Records, Pattern Matching

Localization: Locale-aware formatting for prices and dates

Java 21 Highlights Used

Sealed classes for controlled inheritance (Member types)

Records for immutable data structures (e.g., ImmutableAddress)

Pattern Matching and Switch Expressions for cleaner control flow

Functional Interfaces (Consumer, Predicate, Function) for streamlined operations

Stream API with operations like filter(), map(), sorted(), collect()

Collectors.groupingBy() and partitioningBy() for data aggregation

Concurrency via ExecutorService

File I/O with NIO2 API

Sample Use Cases

Filter books by category or price

Display books sorted by title, author, or date

Automatically apply discounts based on membership level

Display membership expiry and validate access

Support localized views (e.g., date/price formatting)
